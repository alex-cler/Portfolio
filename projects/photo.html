            <h2>The Design Process</h2>
            <p>For my first freelance design website, I needed, as explained above, to make a sober design.
            Matthew, my client, wanted a simple website to show his work with a vintage touch which combined well with his 
            Black ‚ö´Ô∏è & White ‚ö™Ô∏è pictures. First, I decided to go for an image for the landing page , which takes all the screen 
            with some text describing the photographer. I next divided the Homepage into 3 categories: Gallery, Categories, and Contact, 
            which were the 3 main pages that he wanted. I will describe the design I chose for the 3 categories (in the Homepage and 
            the pages dedicated to it).
            </p>
            <h3>Gallery</h3>
            <p>As a big user of Instagram, (You can see his amazing work on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/matt_book_g/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a>),
            I decided to make a Gallery exactly like this one by keeping the same grid.
            For the Gallery page, I keept a simple page as he asked me for, with the 3 categories (Mariage, Portrait & Enterprise) displayed 
            by a 3x3 grid.
            </p>
            <h3>Categories</h3>
            <p>In the Categories part, I put an image that represents the section in question, and for the description of the section,
            I just wrapped it on a camel color block to add this vintage touch that we talked about initially.</p>
            <p>For the Categories page, I just make it a little bit fancier. I display all 3 categories as an unordered list and put 3 pictures
            of each category randomly on the screen with a half opacity. I had some interaction on hover. You can check that on 
            <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/DNVz2SG3w6VDe9nMpsP5fE/Matthieu-Photographe?node-id=1%3A2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Figma</a></p>                
            <h3>Contact</h3>
            <p>The Contact section is only present on the homepage. Personally, I find this quite hard to design in both UX and UI ways,
            so doing another version on a page dedicated to it, it's a conundrum ü§Ø 
            (I love this word. It makes you feel like you're bilingual ü§ìüá¨üáß).
            I'll and need to improve this part because it's an important one, especially in this kind of website, 
            when a customer who wants to contact the photographer for a shooting or a simple question has access to this section.
            That's why I put this, at least, in the navbar.
            Secondly, I put this at the end of the page to let the person, whose navigating the website, see every other section
            before, and maybe making him want to work with Matthew.</p>
