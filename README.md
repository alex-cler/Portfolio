# Portfolio
 Hey! My name is Alex, and I am a Frontend Developer currently living in Paris for my study. I have been learning to program for a year now, and I'm also interested in web development, Motion Design, and UX/UI. I am a self-started developer who has been working as a freelance developer for the first time for a gallery portfolio. I am proficient at working either on teams or alone. I am highly motivated and eager to learn and work on unique and exciting projects.  Here is my Portfolio, where you can see all my most important work that I did alone or with a team because I like doing both of them ðŸ™ƒ. That can be all kinds of work: from designing an interface from scratch, redesigning a website to make this look better,  developing a website mainly with JS or with a framework like React (currently learning the MERN stack, so why not see a MERN Stack app in the future on my Portfolio...). I hope you'll enjoy it and if there is any question about it, feel free to contact me ðŸ¤—.
